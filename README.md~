# IngressAnimations
The code I used to make my series of Ingress fielding videos. 

You can see the videos I've made on [my Youtube channel](http://www.youtube.com/mike40033), or here's a list:

* [Introducing the FanField](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQoFOYP9XO4)
* [More details on FanFields](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C97xCtswH2E)
* [Three common MaxFielding methods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkHtelZxgtg)
* [Generalized Maximum Fielding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iH0JMfR7BTI)
* [Tips on the Cobweb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvvrHEtkxGc)
* [Fielding for Maximum MU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJ0M8vDXxQY)

or, you can see all these videos in a [Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQ2GCHa7ljyPwV5HE0Q8WfF8bwVrrbA5X).

You'll need to know how to program in Java to use this code effectively.
